# This is the Dev branch 🐛🌱
This branch will be where we merge the changes to keep from breaking any working code that is on main.

1. You should clone the repository on VS code, create your own branch and then issue a pull request to get the folders into your VS code.
2. Any pushes and commits should be done in your own branch first and should be working, before pushing to Dev.
3. If any changes are pushed to Dev by another colleague, do not forget to make a pull request on VS code so you have the latest changes.
4. When making commits, make sure to add a comment about what it is that you're changing or what you have done.
